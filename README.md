### General information about the repository
In this repository you can find completed home assignments that were given in the course "Data Analysis in Python" in the 2nd semester of 2022/2023 year of study. All the homework tasks have mark above 9.5 out of 10 and are written in Russian language. 

The ReadMe section is written in English for my own insidious purposes.

#### Guide

1. File "hw1_statistical_paradoxes.ipynb" contains first assignment and includes the basics of data analysis on python: workings with random variables and other statistical indicators with NumPy. Illustrations of calculated values was made with the help of Matplotlib library.

2. File "hw2_stock_market_analysis.ipynb"  includes more in-depth statistical analysis of stock market. In addition to basic statistical indicators such as mean and standard deviation, **VaR** (valued average risk) is also calculated and minimized using **Monte-Carlo** method and **historical** method on the given time interval. In the second half of the assignment the retail data is analyzed and 3 correlation indicators are calculated:
   - **Pearson correlation coefficient**
   - **Matthews correlation coefficient** (Phi coefficient)
   - **Lift coefficient**

3. Next file named "hw3_machine_learning.ipynb" is filled with different data preprocessing and machine learning methods. As for the first point, normalization, standardization, creation of new features, removal of unnecessary features is introduced. Algorithms such as Logistic Rergession, Random Forest Classifier and SVD are used in this task to complete the classification prediction. The resulting quality of classification is based of basic metrics such as **accuracy, precision, recall, roc curve, roc-auc score**.

4. As for the last file, which is named "hw4_hypethesis_ab_aa_testing.ipynb", it contains various tasks regarding statistical tests: rejection or non-rejection of the hypothesis using **z-test, t-test and chi-squared test**. Concerning more practically oriented tests that can be applied in real business cases, **A/B and A/A tests** were carried out.
